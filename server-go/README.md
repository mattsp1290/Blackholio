## Implementation Notes

### WASM Integration
- **Current Status**: Mock implementation for compilation compatibility
- **SpacetimeDB Integration**: Uses simplified host function interface
- **Future Enhancement**: Will be upgraded to use full SpacetimeDB Go bindings when available

### Database Operations
- **Non-WASM builds**: Mock implementations for testing
- **WASM builds**: Simplified mock implementations for compilation
- **Production**: Ready for integration with actual SpacetimeDB host functions

### Build Constraints
- Uses Go build tags to separate WASM and non-WASM code
- `//go:build wasip1 && wasm` for WASM-specific code
- `//go:build !(wasip1 && wasm)` for non-WASM code

## ‚öôÔ∏è Building for SpacetimeDB

### WASM Compilation Target

This project uses **GOOS=wasip1** (not GOOS=js) for WASM compilation because:

- SpacetimeDB is a server-side database system that runs WASM modules directly
- `wasip1` creates standalone WASM modules for WASI-compatible runtimes
- `js` target is designed for browser environments with JavaScript integration
- SpacetimeDB C# implementation also uses `wasi-wasm` target

```bash
# Correct WASM compilation:
GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -o blackholio.wasm .

# Or use the Makefile:
make wasm
```

### Build Constraints

The project uses Go build constraints to separate WASM and non-WASM code:

- `//go:build wasip1 && wasm` - WASM-specific code (wasm.go, reducers/wasm.go)
- `//go:build !(wasip1 && wasm)` - Non-WASM code (main.go, reducers/database_nonwasm.go)

This ensures proper compilation for both development/testing and SpacetimeDB deployment.
